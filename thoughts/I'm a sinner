Hi, My name is Sky and I'm a sinner.

One thing that I will always remember is the phrase "Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic."
It's used in groups such as Alcholics Anonymous to say that alcoholism, if one has it, is not something that one ever gets over.
Of course, this is probably inaccurate.
There are plenty of stories where someone goes cold turkey and never goes back.
So perhaps the phrase is used more to caution people into not letting their guard down, but I cannot help but appreciate the truth of the statement.
You see, alcohol is addictive, especially if used in the wrong context.
Its effects may begin as barely noticable, but will slowly conquer you emotionally then physically.
So even if an alcoholic stops drinking, they will never stop feeling tempted to drink.
Their mind and body have crossed a line and it cannot be undone.

In many ways, alcoholism is like sin.
Of course, being drunk itself is a sin, but on a much deeper level, the same ideas that apply to alcoholism also apply to sin.
"Once a sinner, always a sinner."

You see, we are all addicted to sinning, so much so that it permeates every facet of our being.
And we are all tempted to sin.
Sin is easy, fun, and satisfying--everything that makes a good temptation.
