On the night he was betrayed, Jesus took bread, broke it and gave it to his disciples.
"Take this and eat.
This is my body, broken for you."
After dinner, he took the cup and gave it to his disciples.
"Take this and drink.
This is the cup of my blood.
Drink it in remembrance of me."

When we take the body we remember that Christ, being in the very form of God, came down to us in the body.
He lived as we do in the body.
He breathed, ate and drank like us.
He hungered like us.
He was scared like us.
He was tempted like us.
He bled and was broken just like one of us.
When we take the body, remember the humility and love of Christ, that lengths and the depths that he took to reach us.

The blood represents death.
There is no forgiveness of sins without the pouring out of blood.
The wages of sin is death.
The blood of Christ represents God's provision for us of a worthy sacrifice and his just forgiveness of sins.

This blood is also the blood of a new covenant, stronger than the blood that bound Abraham to God, stronger than the blood of ten thousand bulls.
This blood brings new hope for us who by faith call upon its power.
The hope is for true righteousness, everlasting life and eternal joy in the blessing of God.
