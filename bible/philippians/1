"Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. [...] Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed."

Of the people who preach Christ, Paul seperates those who preach out of good will and love, and those who preach from envy and rivalry, particulary against Paul since these people are seeking to afflict Paul. Yet Paul does not mind either way, but rejoices in both types of people since either way, Christ is preached through them. In this way, Paul places Christ's glory above his own wellbeing.
