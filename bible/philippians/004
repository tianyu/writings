[10]	Here we must remember that Paul had, or will, sent all of his companions away: Timothy, Onecimus, and Epaphroditus.
But Paul rejoices greatly, and we will describe the root of this rejoicing shortly.

[11-13]	Paul has learned to be content in all situations, whether it be in plenty or in want.
This secret that allows him to find contentment comes from his commitment to the Lord.
So Paul, being content in every situation, is able to face all situations.
Indeed as Paul admits, it is through God's power that he accomplishes all things.
And so we ascertain that the secret to attaining all contentment is to rely on the God who will give one the power to do so.
The reason why we are not content is because we are not yet preoccupied with the Lord.

[14]	So we find that Paul would have been content whether or not Epaphroditus was sent to his supply.
What then is the root of his rejoicing?
He states that the Philippians have not stopped supporting him in his mission, from the beginning since Macedonia through Thessalonica.
But it was not in these gifts that Paul rejoices, but in the fruit that was borne through these gifts to the glory of God and to the credit of the Philippians.
These gifts not only left Paul well supplied, but they became "a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God."

As it is written, "Bring the full tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house.
And thereby put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need."
(Malachi 3:10) Shall not God provide for the Philippians, and indeed us all, in accordance with our faithfulness?
