[1-2]	If the church has benefited in any way from the blessings in Christ, then they should be unified.

[3-8]	The key to unity in the church is humility, and humility is to "count others more significant than [our]selves."
Paul encourages the people to put the needs of others above their own.
What Paul is telling them to do is to put themselves in each other's shoes.

If you can't be open to others, they will never be open to you.
Being open to others means subjecting yourself to their conditions.
It means understanding their past in order to grasp their current world view.
It means submerging yourself in their life and allowing the opportunity of becoming like them.
Being open to another requires fully understanding their person and allowing yourself the opportunity to change into them.

Note that this doesn't mean actually changing into them.
I'm not saying that if you're trying to understand a drug addict, you should become addicted to drugs yourself.
But to understand a drug addict, you should experience the circumstances that led them into drugs, understand how they've been treated because of their addiction and understand to the best of your ability their life in their current state of addiction.
How are the treated by their family?
Friends?
Significant others?Understanding a drug addict isn't stupid.
You shouldn't get addicted to drugs yourself.
But understanding a drug addict is hard.
It's hard to experience a drug addict's life to the point where you'd be tempted to do the drugs yourself.

Some of the most inspiring people are people who have been there, done that and gotten out of it.
And that's exactly what we need to do if we're going to be open to someone else.
We need to have experienced their situation, lived like they do, but still remain Godly and pure.

Christ is, not surprisingly, the most powerful example of this.
That though he was in the form of God, came to be in the for of man -- and died for us.
Christ was open to us.
If we're addicted to sin, then Christ came and experienced for himself everything that has ever led us to sin.
He lowered himself to our level and experienced first hand the temptations facing us.
And he beat it.
And then he died for us so that we can beat it too.

And here Paul charges us to be like Christ -- to open ourselves to others, to make others more important than ourselves, to truly understand others, to dare to be changed by others.
The only difference, of course, is that we might also learn a thing or two from others.
But this openness, as Paul describes, is the solution to rivalry and conceit.
It is the secret to Christian unity, which each of us, if we have ever been blessed by Christ -- with any encouragement in Him, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy -- must strive for.
