[4-5]
Often times, we want to surrender our lives to God.
Yet this is often easier said than done.

Here, David shows a remarkable willingness to surrender.
What motivates him?
Because, writes David, God is the instrument of his salvation.

Salvation is when one is brought out of a situation where they were hopeless to escape by their own power.
Therefore, being saved by powers higher than his own, David puts his trust in the powers' owner--God.

So if we're struggling with surrendering our lives to God, do we really view God as our saviour?
Can we point out in our lives a time when God came through for us clearly and mightily, showing to us personally that his power and glory far surpasses our own?

As sinful humans, we default to relying on ourselves everyday.
But to David, his hope is in God all day long.
If we can recognize God's superiority over us, then we would rely on God just like him.
Then we also would plead with God to show us his paths and to teach us his truths.

David surrenders his heart in reponse to God's mighty work in his life.
He asks to see God's paths because he knows that God's plan is better than his plan.
He asks to learn God's truths because God's wisdom is superior to his wisdom.

The Christian faith is not one that blindly follows God.
But because God is one who is active, powerful and just, the Christian faith is based on real testimonies of God's strength and provision.
It is securely built on the rock of God's faithfulness.
